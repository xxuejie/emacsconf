My emacs configuraion file.

This is not used anymore since I choose to use `package.el` instead of git submodules to manage dependency. As a result, the latest emacs config file is only one file at [here](https://github.com/xxuejie/dotfiles/blob/master/.emacs.d/init.el).

This is only kept for backup purposes.
